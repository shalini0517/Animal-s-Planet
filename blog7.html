        <p>
            Elephants are a select group of proboscideans belonging to the family Elephantidae. They are the largest
            existing land animals. Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African
            forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.
            The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which
            are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The
            large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. The
            pillar-like legs carry their great weight.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">1.What is special about elephants??!</h2>
        <p>
            The average lifespan of an elephant is from 50 to 70 years. Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and
            weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg. Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000–
            6,000kg.
            They are highly intelligent animals with complex emotions, feelings, compassion and self-awareness
            (elephants are one of very few species to recognize themselves in a mirror!). The gestation period of an
            elephant is 22 months. That's almost 2 years, the longest pregnancy of any mammal!
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">2.Their tusks are actually teeth!</h2>
        <p>
            Elephant tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth which first appear when elephants are around 2 years old.
            Tusks continue growing throughout their lives.
            Tusks are used to help with feeding - prising bark off trees or digging up roots - or as a defense when
            fighting.
            But these beautiful tusks often cause elephants danger. They're made from ivory; a much desired object. Read
            on to find out why elephants are under threat.
        </p>


        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">3.They’ve got thick skin!</h2>
        <p>
            An elephant’s skin is 2.5cm thick in most places. The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 10
            times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down.
            They keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking regular dust and mud baths.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">4.You can tell the two species apart by their ears!
        </h2>
        <p>There are two species of elephant: African and Asian. The ears of African elephants are much larger than
            their cousins and are described as being shaped like the African continent, whereas the ears of Asian
            elephants are shaped like the Indian subcontinent.
            There’s also a trunk difference - African elephants have two ‘fingers’ at the tip of their trunks, whereas
            Asian elephants have one. </p>
