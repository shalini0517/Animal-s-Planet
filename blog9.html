        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">1. Do squirrels carry diseases?</h2>
        <p>
            Squirrels are known to carry numerous diseases, though only a few are dangerous to humans. Some of the more
            common include tularemia, typhus, plague, and ringworm. Such diseases are transmitted through bites or other
            forms of direct contact with infected squirrels.
            Tularemia, typhus, and plague have symptoms that mimic the flu and can be deadly when left untreated. While
            all mammals are capable of getting rabies, squirrels are very rarely rabid.</p>
        <h4>Parasites and Disease</h4>
        <br>
        <p>Other diseases squirrels transmit to humans come from the various parasites they carry. Rife with parasites
            such as fleas, ticks, and mites, squirrels living in proximity to homes frequently pass these tiny pests on
            to both humans and pets. Some of the diseases humans can get from the parasites include Lyme disease,
            Encephalitis, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">2. Do squirrels have memory?</h2>
        <p>
            Squirrels have an important ecological role, especially in forest ecosystems, McCleery said.
            <br><br>
            Grey squirrels are known to have good long-term memory -- they are "scatter-hoarders," collecting and hiding
            thousands of nuts every autumn. ... "It's also different from what we see in the wild because they're
            remembering things for longer than the few months of memory needed to find hidden food."
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">3. Shape & Size of Squirrel?</h2>
        <p>
            Since there are so many types of squirrels, they range greatly in size. The smallest squirrel is the African
            pygmy squirrel. It grows to 2.8 to 5 inches (7 to 13 centimeters) in length and weighs just 0.35 ounces (10
            grams). The Indian giant squirrel is the world's largest known squirrel. It grows to 36 inches (1 meter)
            long and weighs up to 4 pounds (1.8 kilograms).
            <br>
            Grey squirrels, commonly found in North America, are medium-size squirrels. They grow to 15 to 20 inches
            (38.1 to 50.8 cm) in length, with their tails adding an extra 6 to 9.5 inches (15.24 to 24.13 cm) to their
            length. They typically weigh about 1 to 1.5 pounds (0.45 to 0.68 kg).
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">4. What do squirrel eat?</h2>
        <p>
            Many people think that squirrels only eat nuts, but this isn't true. Squirrels are omnivores, which means
            they like to eat plants and meat. Squirrels mainly eat fungi, seeds, nuts and fruits, but they will also
            munch on eggs, small insects, caterpillars, small animals and even young snakes.
            There are more than 200 species of squirrels, according to the Integrated Taxonomic Information System
            (ITIS), and they are categorized into three types: tree squirrels, ground squirrels and flying squirrels.
            These three categories are further broken down into many squirrel types, such as Albino, Mountain Tree,
            Antelope, Spotted, Grey, American Red, Douglas, Fox, Pygmy, Northern Flying, Southern, Arizona Gray, Idaho,
            Arctic Ground, Albert’s, Franklin, Richardson, Rock, White and Black squirrel.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(231, 19, 30)" class="blog-subtitle">5. What squirrels do all day?</h2>
        <p>
            Activity: Diurnal in nature, squirrels are mainly active during the day. They do not hibernate but will
            typically spend long hours in their nests during the cold winter months. ... Communication: Squirrels are
            extremely vocal - they bark, chatter, scream, and purr to communicate with one another.
            “There are three squirrels commonly found in Florida.
            The gray squirrel is smaller than the others and is gray in color.
            The fox squirrel, on the other hand, is larger than the gray squirrel,
            and is the most variably colored mammal in North America,” McCleery said.
