            Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodent) until 1912, when they were moved
            into a new order, Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Below are some of the genera and species of the
            rabbit.
        </p>
        <p>Rabbits are small mammals with fluffy, short tails, whiskers and distinctive long ears. There are more than
            30 species around the world, and while they live in many different environments, they have many things in
            common.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">1. What is special about rabbit?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the world’s best-known rabbits is the Warner Bros cartoon character, Bugs Bunny — who’s often seen
            munching on a carrot! In fact, carrots aren’t a natural part of a rabbit’s diet and can give bunnies an
            upset stomach if they eat too many.
        </p>
        <p>Rabbits are very effective baby-makers! Mother rabbits are pregnant for between 28-31 days, giving birth to
            up to 14 baby rabbits – called kittens – in a single litter. There are over 45 million rabbits in the UK
            alone! </p>

        <p>
            Any breed of rabbit can make a great house pet.
            The main considerations when choosing a type of rabbit are size and level of care.
            The so-called “giant” rabbit breeds can grow to over 12 pounds.
            They need more food and space and can be harder to handle than smaller rabbits.
            <br><br>
            The “mini” rabbit breeds can weigh as little as 4 pounds.
            Small rabbits require delicate handling and some may nip more than larger rabbits.
            Fluffy rabbits like angoras are adorable, but they can require daily grooming.
            <br><br>
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">3. Size of Rabbit?</h2>
        <p>Some rabbits are about the size of a cat, and some can grow to be as big as a small child. Small rabbits,
            such as pygmy rabbits, can be as little as 8 inches (20 centimeters) in length and weigh less than a pound.
            Larger species grow to 20 inches (50 cm) and more than 10 lbs. (4.5 kilograms). </p>
        <br>
        <p>According to Dr. Lianne McLeod, a veterinarian, in a column for The Spruce website, the largest rabbit breeds
            are the checkered giant, over 11 lbs. (5 kg); Flemish giant, 13 lbs. (5.9 kg) and over; giant papillon, 13
            to 14 lbs. 5.9 to 6.3 kg); and giant chinchilla, 12 to 16 lbs. (5.4 to 7.2 kg). The world's longest rabbit,
            according to Guinness World Records, is a Flemish giant that clocked in at 4 feet 3 inches (129 cm) and 49
            pounds (22 kg).</p>
        <br>

        <div class="blog-img-container"></div>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwGL2B8M9D3eF7cs3JyLdF-970-80.jpg" alt="blog5" class="blog-img">
        </div>

        <p>Small rabbit breeds include the Britannia Petite, under 2.5 lbs. (1.1 kg); Netherland dwarf, under 2.5 lbs.;
            dwarf hotot, under 3 lbs. (1.3 kg); and Himalayan, 2.5 to 4.5 lbs. (1.1 to 2 kg).</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">4. Diet ?</h2>
        <p>Rabbits are herbivores. This means that they have a plant-based diet and do not eat meat. Their diets include
            grasses, clover and some cruciferous plants, such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts. They are opportunistic
            feeders and also eat fruits, seeds, roots, buds, and tree bark, according to ADW.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">5. Habitat ?</h2>
        <p>While originally from Europe and Africa, rabbits are now found all over the world. They occupy most of the
            world’s land masses, except for southern South America, the West Indies, Madagascar, and most islands
            southeast of Asia, according to ADW. Although originally absent from South America, Australia, New Zealand,
            Java, rabbits have been introduced to these locations during the last few centuries.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits
            don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in
            woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">6. Habits ?</h2>
        <p>Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for
            rabbits is at dusk and dawn. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide
            from predators. </p>
        <br>
        <div class="blog-img-container"></div>
        <img src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rGwv6nabeTazpc3GcAfMa-970-80.jpg" alt="blog5" class="blog-img">
        </div>

        <p>Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a
            constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely
            evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">7. Classification/Taxonomy ?</h2>
        <p>This is the taxonomy of rabbits, according to ADW, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)
            and the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS):</p>
        <p>Kingdom: Animalia </p>
        <p>Phylum: Chordata </p>
        <p>Subphylum: Vertebrata</p>
        <p>Class: Mammalia </p>
        <p>Order: Lagomorpha </p>
        <p>Family: Leporidae Genera: </p>

        <h4>Species</h4>
        <p>Brachylagus (pygmy rabbits)</p>
        <p>Bunolagus (riverine rabbits)</p>
        <p>Nesolagus (Sumatran rabbits, Annamite striped rabbits)</p>
        <p>Oryctolagus (Old World rabbits, European rabbits, domestic rabbits)</p>
        <p>Pentalagus (Amami rabbits)</p>
        <p>Poelagus (Bunyoro rabbits)</p>
        <p>Romerolagus (volcano rabbits)</p>
        <p>Sylvilagus (cottontail rabbits)</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are more than 50 species of rabbits. The domestic rabbit is Oryctolagus cuniculus.</p>
