        <p>
            Zebras, horse & asses are the members of the Equus genus...
            <br>
            "Zebras are famous for their contrasting black and white stripes – but until very recently no one really
            knew why they sport their unusual striped pattern".
            <br>
            It’s a question that’s been discussed as far back as 150 years ago by great Victorian biologists
            "Charles Darwin" and "Alfred Russel Wallace".
            <br>
        <h3>Species of Zebra</h3>
        <p>there are 3 species of zebra: </p>
        <p>1. Plain's Zebra</p>
        <p>2. Grevy's Zebra</p>
        <p>3. Mountain Zebra</p>
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">1.What is special about a zebra?!</h2>
        <p>Their stripes perhaps serve to dazzle and confuse predators and biting insects, or to control the animal's
            body heat. Because each individual's stripes are unique, their stripes may also have a social purpose,
            helping zebras to recognise one other.</p>


        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">2.What is a zebra' habitat?</h2>
        <p>
            They have a wide range in east and southern Africa. They usually live in treeless grasslands and savanna
            woodlands and are absent from deserts, rainforests, and wetlands. This species habitat is shrinking,
            however, and they are now extinct in Burundi and Lesotho.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">3.Life span of Zebra!</h2>
        <p>A zebra's average lifespan in the wild is 25 years.</p>
        <p>Burchell's zebras that freely roam in nature have approximate lifespans of 20 to 30 years. They usually have
            longer lifespans when they live in captive environments such as zoos. In those cases, they can often live
            for up to 40 years.</p>

        <p>Mountain zebras have similar typical wild lifespans as Burchell's zebras. They often survive to be at least
            20 years in age in the wild. As far as captive mountain zebras go, the longest-living specimen made it to
            just 6 months shy of 30 years old.
            Grevy's zebras out in their native environments frequently survive to around 12 or 13 years in age. Some of
            them even live for as long as 18 years. Captive specimens generally have longer lives, often in the scope of
            22 to 30 years.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">4.Where do zebras sleep?</h2>
        <p>Do zebras sleep on their feet? Like horses, zebras sleep standing up, and usually only when in the safety of
            a group.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">5.Are zebras friendly?</h2>
        <p>Familiarity with human hunter gatherers may also have fostered a strong avoidance response in the zebra. All
            of this means that zebra are not really “people friendly” and as a species they do not fit the criteria for
            domestication.</p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(35, 21, 228)" class="blog-subtitle">6.Interesting facts about zebras</h2>
        <p>1. There Are Three Species of Zebra.</p>
        <p>2. Zebras Are Wild Animals That Cannot Be Domesticated.</p>
        <p>3. A Group of Zebras is Called a ‘Dazzle’.</p>
        <p>4. Zebras Can Travel Long Distances.</p>
