            "Life is like the monkey bars: you have to let go to move forward. Once you make the decision to leap into
            entrepreneurship, be sure to loosen your grasp on old concepts so you can swing your way to new ones".

            "An American monkey, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it again, and thus is much wiser than
            most men".

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">1. What is special about a monkey?</h2>
        <p>
            Monkeys also have their own unique set of fingerprints just like humans do. ... Monkeys have a brain that is
            large for their size and it is part of the reason why they are so intelligent. They are believed to be
            smarter than other primates including Apes and Lemurs.

            So What Do Monkeys Eat in the Wild? Generally, they do eat fruits, like figs, but also seeds, leaves,
            flowers, insects, and nuts. Gelada monkeys prefer to munch on grass and baboons even eat meat when they
            catch it such as young antelope, rabbits, and birds like guinea fowl. Personally, I'd prefer bananas.
            Apparently, bananas are like a highly-coveted treat for our monkey friends, similar to kids craving a slice
            of chocolate cake (aka my sister). Monkeys do actually eat fruits similar to the bananas we know and love,
            but they're quite different than the grocery store-kind built for humans to consume. Wild bananas contain a
            lot of hard seeds and little fruit one could actually eat.

        <p>
            As babies these big-eyed, furry creatures may seem harmless. But once they reach sexual maturity, experts
            warn, monkeys can become aggressive. And some primates harbor deadly diseases, like herpes B, that they can
            pass on to human primates via bites and scratches.
            Monkeys can carry parasites and zoonotic diseases that are dangerous to humans. They may seem to be in
            perfect health, but when they inevitably bite or scratch you, you may end up with a variety of health issues
            passed to you from your monkey that were dormant in the monkey's system.

            Monkeys as smart as TODDLERS: Scientists say apes can understand abstract properties. Monkeys are as smart
            as a three-year-old child when it comes to solving puzzles. Capuchins, chimpanzees and bonobos were able to
            pull a piece of string after watching how it released a food reward.
            <br>
            <b>Capuchins</b> are the most intelligent New World monkeys – perhaps as intelligent as chimpanzees. They
            are noted for their ability to fashion and use tools.
