        <p>
            White tiger facts show us how these beautiful tigers have more unique characteristics when compared to other
            tigers than just the color of their fur. They are of course a majestic white shade with black stripes but
            they also have a distinct pink nose and blue eyes. They are often much larger than other tigers, both at
            birth and as they mature. A white tiger is usually considered to be an adult tiger between two and three
            years of age.
