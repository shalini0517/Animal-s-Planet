            million years.</h1>

        <p>In 1941 Richard Owen said that the dinosaurs were almost hot blooded.</p>
        <p>L. Neil Smith said that "This planet is 15 million years overdue for an asteroid strike like the one that
            killed the dinosaurs".</p>


        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">1. What is the history of dinosaurs?!</h2>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs are a diverse group of reptiles of the clade Dinosauria. They first appeared during the Triassic
            period, between 243 and 233.23 million years ago, although the exact origin and timing of the evolution of
            dinosaurs is the subject of active research.
            Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that have lived on Earth for about 245 million years. In 1842, the English
            naturalist Sir Richard Owen coined the term Dinosauria, derived from the Greek deinos, meaning “fearfully
            great,” and sauros, meaning “lizard.” Dinosaur fossils have been found on all seven continents.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">2. What are dinosaurs known for??</h2>
        <p>
            Dinosaurs are a group of reptiles that dominated the land for over 140 million years (more than 160 million
            years in some parts of the world). They evolved diverse shapes and sizes, from the fearsome giant
            Spinosaurus to the chicken-sized Microraptor, and were able to survive in a variety of ecosystems.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the reasons for dinosaurs' success is that they had straight back legs, perpendicular to their
            bodies. This allowed them to use less energy to move than other reptiles that had a sprawling stance like
            today's lizards and crocodiles.

            With their legs positioned under their bodies rather than sticking out to the side, dinosaurs' weight was
            also better supported.

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">3. Tyrannosaurus Rex was the most ferocious dinosaur.!</h2>
        <div class="blog-img-container"></div>

        <p>The Tyrannosaurus Rex had the strongest bite of any animal on Earth, ever!
            <br>
            The dinosaur was given the name “king of the tyrant lizards” and was about the size of a school bus.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">4. The longest dinosaur name is Micropachycephalosaurus. </h2>
        <p>That is definitely a mouthful.
            The Micropachycephalosaurus was found in China and is the longest dinosaur name there is.
            It’s probably the hardest one to say as well!
            It was a herbivore which means it was a vegetarian.
            This dinosaur would have lived around 84 – 71 million years ago. </p>

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">5. An astroid hit and they became extinct.</h2>
        <p>Dinosaurs became extinct around 66 million years ago.
            An astroid hit Earth which made lots of dust and dirt rise into the air.
            This blocked the sun and made Earth very cold.
            One of the main theories is that because the climate changed, the dinosaurs could not survive and became
            extinct. </p>

        </p>

        <h2 style="color: green" class="blog-subtitle">6. Interesting Facts about T-REX.</h2>
        <p>1. The Tyrannosaurus had a life span of around 30 years.</p>
        <p>2. Tyrannosaurus is from the Greek word meaning Tyrant Lizard.</p>
        <p>3. The dinosaur has many similar features to birds. ...</p>
        <p>4. Its arms were too short to reach its mouth.</p>
        <p>5. It lived in North America in river valleys and forests.</p>
